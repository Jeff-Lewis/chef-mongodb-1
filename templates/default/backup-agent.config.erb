# `sslTrustedServerCertificates` is path on disk that contains the trusted certificate
# authority certificates in PEM format. The certificates will be used to verify
# the server certificate returned from any MongoDBs running with SSL.

# field to false. That configuration is only recommended for testing purposes
# as it makes connections suspectiable to MITM attacks.
